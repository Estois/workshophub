# WH-8: Send notification after registration or waitlist promotion

**Type:** Story
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** Medium

**Context**
Employees should receive feedback when they successfully register or are promoted from the waitlist. This confirmation helps them know their seat is secured without needing to check back.

This is a **trainee exercise story**. It is not implemented in the baseline template.

**Description**
As an employee, I want to receive a notification when I register or am promoted from the waitlist so that I know my seat is confirmed.

For training simplicity, the in-app UI shows a success banner immediately after the action. A backend notification (console log or Slack webhook) fires as a side effect and does not block the response.

**Acceptance Criteria**

User interactions (in-app feedback):
- After successfully registering (confirmed), the page shows a success banner: "You're registered! [Session title] on [formatted date]"
- After joining the waitlist, the page shows: "You're on the waitlist for [Session title]. We'll let you know if a spot opens up."
- Both banners appear immediately after the form is submitted without a page reload
- The banners can be dismissed by the user or auto-dismiss after a few seconds
- If the backend notification fails, the banner still appears (notification failure is silent)

Backend notification:
- After a successful registration (confirmed), a notification event is emitted on the server
- After a waitlist promotion (confirmed via WH-5), a notification event is emitted on the server
- The notification includes: employee name, email, session title, session date, status (confirmed or promoted)
- For baseline: notification is logged to the server console
- Optional extension: if SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL is set in the environment, a Slack message is sent to the configured channel
- Notification failures must not fail the registration or promotion (fire-and-forget)

**Out of Scope**
- Real email delivery
- SMS notifications
- Notification for cancellation
- Notification history or inbox

**Suggested Tests**
- Registration success → success banner shown in UI
- Waitlist registration → waitlist banner shown in UI
- Registration success → notification logged with correct employee and session details
- Waitlist promotion → notification logged
- Notification failure does not affect API response
- Slack notification sent when SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL is set (optional, integration test)

**Implementation Hint**
Use an event emitter or a simple async side-effect function. The core registration path should not await the notification.
